# Neural_Networks_GenerativeModels

In this notebook we observed one variant of the solution in the field of generatiev models. For the GAN we used generator and discriminator models to generate images of peoples faces. Based on the Leave-one-out-1-NN accuracy metric, we achieved result of 0.7647. More about the experiments in generative_models.ipynb file.
